# Authentification-AspCore-Reactjs
Welcome to our project! This is a web application that consists of a backend API built using .NET 3.1 and a front-end user interface built using ReactJS 18.

The backend API provides a RESTful interface that allows the front-end UI to communicate with the server. The API uses .NET 3.1, which is a stable version of the .NET framework, to handle incoming requests and manage data storage. The API is designed to be scalable and secure, with robust error handling and validation built-in.

The UI is designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and accessible across various devices and platforms. It communicates with the backend API to retrieve and display data, enabling users to interact with the system and perform various tasks.

Our development team is committed to delivering a high-quality applic
